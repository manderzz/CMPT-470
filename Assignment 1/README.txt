Upon loading the webpage, the board will be generated, correct guesses will display green, incorrect will display red.

I have placed an innerHTML value of "1" for all tiles that correspond to a treausre, and "-" for tiles that DO NOT contain a treasure.
In the styles.css under "tile", the "content-visibility" is set to hidden, please set this value to "visible" to allow you to see which tiles are treaures. ( For testing if the alert works when all tiles correct tiles are revealed.)
